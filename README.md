# QuizGuessByAlbum

This is a web program featuring a music quiz wirtten in Java script with ReactJS framework.
It was developed as an independet project while I was learning ReactJS.

This quiz has 5 rounds. In every round the user goal is to guess who is the artist by it's albums.
The user get 5 points if the first guess is correct, 3 points if the second one is correct and 1 if the third one.
If thie third guess is wrong, next round will start and the user will not get any points.
